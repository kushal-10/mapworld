## Collections of games to be run with the [clemcore framework](https://github.com/clp-research/clemcore)

## Installation (Python 3.10+)

Install the required dependencies to run all games: 

`pip install -r clembench/requirements.txt`

This will also install the `clem` CLI tool.


### API Keys

To use APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, etc.), create a `key.json` file that includes the required fields for each backend. The template file (key.json.template) is provided.

Copy the file into `/Users/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/.clemcore/` for MacOS or `` for Linux.

### Models, Backends, Games

After the installation you will have access to the `clem` CLI tool. The main functions are:

```
(myclem) clem list games               # list the games available for a run
(myclem) clem list backends            # list the backends available for a run
(myclem) clem list models              # list the models available for a run
(myclem) clem run -g <game> -m <model> # runs the game benchmark; also scores
(myclem) clem transcribe               # translates interactions into html files
(myclem) clem score                    # computes individual performance measures
(myclem) clem eval                     # computes overall performances measures; requires scores
```

To add new custom models, populate the `model_registry.json` file with the required fields  (template is provided as *model_registry.json.template*).

To run your custom game, populate the `game_registry.json` file with the required fields and directory path (template is provided as *game_registry.json.template*).
